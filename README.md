# Dialogue-Summarization
Developed a summarization model for dialogues of varying lengths and turns, addressing the challenge of optimizing VRAM usage. Enhanced T5 summarization performance using techniques including custom preprocessing pipelines, back-translation, and LoRA-based fine-tuning.   

**Role:** Data preprocessing and augmentation, model selection   
**Results:** Improved ROUGE-L(0.2521->0.3932) and **overall score(23.2257 -> 39.0576)**
